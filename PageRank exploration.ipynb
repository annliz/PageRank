    "While the inputs to Google's overall ranking algorithm are secret, the output of PageRank is not. There are tools that  allow you to enter a URL and see the Google PageRank of the corresponding page. For example, if you enter nuevaschool.org into [this one](https://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php), it will tell you that Nueva's homepage has a PR of 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two notes:\n",
    "1. Recall that this is not the raw output -- the PageRank algorithm can produce an arbitrarily high output, so to make it easier to understand, Google maps the output to a scale of 0-10, where 0 is low and 10 is high.\n",
    "2. This tool is kind of a pain to use since it requires that you enter a captcha every time you submit. If you find a better one, let me know! Just be careful, as many of these tools have a bunch of spammy ads on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions\n",
    "1. Play around with this tool and report back the values of some webpages. Can you find webpages of each rank between 0 and 10? \n",
    "2. Describe what kinds of webpages are represented in each rank. For example, you might say that pages of rank 9 are usually the homepages of the services of the biggest Internet companies in the world."

Pages of rank 9 include most of the most popular websites, such as Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, etc. Ranks 5-8 seem to contain recognizeable (not sketchy) sites that people across the country/world might be interested in, with its nicheness/specifity increasing as pagerank decreases. PR 4 seems to include web pages of specific institutions/organizations that only people who are affiliated with them might be interested in, such as private schools and events. I couldn't find any pages with ranks 1-3, and PR 0 contains websites that are extremely irrelevant or sketchy (such as the one I listed). However, more legitimate pages such as the San Mateo County website (smcgov.org) are also ranked 0, so maybe there's an issue with the prchecker website."

    "\n",
    "The damping factor controls how extreme each page's PR is. When the damping factor is small, all pages have a very similar pagerank; when the damping factor is large, their PRs vary a lot. This is because, in the pagerank formula, the damping factor controls how heavily the part that is different for each page is weighted. When the damping factor is small, such as 0.2, the sum of the PR(i)/C(i) quotients, which is the part that is different for each page, is only 20% of the score (while all pages have the same large constant, 0.8), so it's difficult to make the scores that different. The converse is true with a large damping constant, where the sum of PR(i)/C(i) quotients play a much larger role (and the constant a much smaller role) in determining a page's score. However, changing the damping constant will *not* change the *rank* of each page, only its actual PR *value*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the damping factor is larger than 1 or less than -1, the pagerank of each page does not converge, instead decreasing to negative infinity. This is because either d or 1-d becomes negative, decreasing the PR forever. A pages PR does still converge to a fixed number if the damping factor is between -1 and 0, although it might be negative and the order will be different. However we can disregard all these cases because they represent a negative probability which (I'm pretty sure) doesn't exist.\n",

The initial PRs can be positive, negative, zero, decimals, very large, or very small but they will eventually all converge to the same values as if they all started with 1/n (as long as the damping factor represents a valid probability less than 1). And no matter what the initial PR values are for the pages, the final average pagerank after many iterations is always 1. However, if the initial PRs are very different, it would take more iterations for the PRs to converge to their final stable values."

This is because the large amount of fake pages makes the pages that don't link to home (the five reviews) negligible.
